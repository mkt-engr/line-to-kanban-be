-- Migration 003: Rename messages to tasks
--
-- Note: This migration was originally intended to rename:
-- - ENUM: message_status → task_status
-- - Table: messages → tasks
-- - Indexes: messages_*_idx → tasks_*_idx
--
-- However, the database schema was already manually updated to use 'tasks'.
-- This migration file serves as a version marker only.
--
-- If you need to apply this migration on a fresh database with 'messages' table,
-- run the following SQL manually:
--
-- ALTER TYPE message_status RENAME TO task_status;
-- ALTER TABLE messages RENAME TO tasks;
-- ALTER INDEX messages_created_at_idx RENAME TO tasks_created_at_idx;
-- ALTER INDEX messages_status_idx RENAME TO tasks_status_idx;
-- ALTER INDEX messages_user_id_idx RENAME TO tasks_user_id_idx;

-- Empty migration - schema already in correct state
